## About

The app was done in the 5 hour frame specified from starting it

The error handling does not inform the user properly that a user does not exist or the field is empty

Could have added loading spinners when requests are made

Some iterations are messy and some design patterns might be outdated (The tutorial I watched was from 2018)

There is still a "Unique key prop error" which appears during the first search, that I could not solve in time even with the React Developer Tools extension  

The interface of the application can use improvements

Learning React from scratch and doing this assignment in the same day was not one of my brightest moments
